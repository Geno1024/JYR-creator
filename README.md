# JYR Creator

I decided to do the JYR (Jieyang Rubik Record) that night, but I met a problem.

WCA database can be downloaded but just wrote the country, (CubingChina)[cubingchina.com] recorded the city but can't be downloaded.

So I decided to write a sh file, to add the city after every line of WCA database.

First I did it by Java, since I am more familiar in Java than in shell.

Later I found it may be exciting if I did so purely sh.

Then I am trying it.
